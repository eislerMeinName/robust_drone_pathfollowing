# robust-drone-pathfollowing 
Robust-drone-pathfollowing is a [Gym-Pybullet-Drones](https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones) (branch master) extension, which is a [simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) OpenAI [Gym environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control) based on [PyBullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) for multi-agent reinforcement learning with quadrocopter. This extension provides a Gym environment that uses a stochastical, random wind field for single-agent reinforcment learning. Also, it applies Linear Curriculum Learning (LCL) and Self-Pased Curriculum Learning on the
RL problem.
This branch is the thesis, written in tex.
